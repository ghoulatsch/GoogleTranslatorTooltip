# Hello World

# What?
In browser translation for mobile phone users via userscript.

* set your languages etc at "+"
* if you want to replace the icon or translation box size/position go into the code and check the first rows

# Tested with
Pixel 4a

Tempermonkey Extention

# Why?
Currently i (try :P) to learn a new language: russian. It's pretty cool.
To dive into i choose to hear russian music on youtube late at night in bed with my phone.
Excercise reading the kyrilic alpahat in the comments i wanted also to know what was written.
Unfortunatly there was no easy translation tool by hand. Only clunky extra apps.
So i started a search in the world wide web if some clever women and men had already come up with something for mobile users.
YES but NO?!
Best not to start from nothing. Thanks to ningfei who forked the translation tooltip so i can fork it. Super greasy!
Here we go... i started to learn coding userscripts.

PS: I'm still learning russian...
